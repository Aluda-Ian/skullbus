#Problem statement

Parents of Kenyan high school students face a complex, inefficient, and often non-transparent system for arranging student transport. This causes stress, 
and financial uncertainty, and can negatively impact a student's education.
due to

1. Unreliable vetting of transport providers: Parents lack information about driver qualifications and vehicle safety standards.
2. Cash handling vulnerabilities: Complex cash collection processes raise concerns about transparency and potential misuse of funds.
3. Limited communication and tracking: Parents have minimal information about their child's journey, creating anxiety and hindering emergency response.

#currently teachers and parents coordinate with the transport providers, one of the parents or a teacher is tasked with collecting of the fares which is a tiresome activity
and also poses challenges of honesty and transparency.

#features to solve the above problems



1. Online bus booking and payment dashboard for parents
2. Linking neighboring schools so that the bus can pick up students who are going to the same locality eg. western Kenya for capacity utilization
3. Notification system for parents and school administration to know their student's journey and notification 
4. Easy bookiping for the matatu owners
